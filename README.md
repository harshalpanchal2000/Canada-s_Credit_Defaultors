## Overview
The Credit Card Default Predictor Dashboard provides an analytical view of credit card holders and predicts the probability of default. The model aims to help financial institutions identify high-risk customers and make informed decisions.

## Tableau Public Link

## Data Source
The data for this project includes records of credit card holders with the following attributes:
- ID
- Age
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education Level
- Repayment Status
- Default Probability

## Features
- *Prediction Accuracy*: Indicates the accuracy of the model in predicting defaults (82% accurate).
- *Model Prediction*: Shows whether the model predicts a default or no default.
- *Default Probability*: Displays the probability of default for each credit card holder.

## Visualizations
1. *Credit Card Holder Info*: Displays filtered information about credit card holders, such as age range, gender, marital status, education, and repayment status.
2. *Default Probability*: Bar charts showing the probability of default for each credit card holder in the filtered dataset.
3. *Model Prediction*: Highlights whether the model predicts a default or no default, along with the associated probability.

## Usage
To use this dashboard effectively:
1. *Filter Credit Card Holder Info*: Use the filters to narrow down the dataset by age, gender, marital status, education, and repayment status.
2. *Analyze Default Probability*: Examine the bar charts to see the predicted probability of default for each credit card holder.
3. *Model Prediction Insights*: Check the model prediction section to understand if the model predicts a default or no default, along with the confidence probability.

### Interactivity
- *Filters*: Adjust filters to refine the dataset based on specific criteria.
- *Hover for Details*: Hover over any data point for detailed information on default probability and demographic attributes.
